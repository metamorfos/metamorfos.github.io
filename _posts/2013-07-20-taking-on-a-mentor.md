# Introduction
When I met [Simon][simons_twitter], I was just a guy that liked IT and
computers, but couldn't do anything of value. I used my computer for my own
enjoyment and not as a tool for creation. I had started to drift into
programming, which I was introduced to in high school, but no more than
that.

After graduating, I decided that I should learn how to create these things I
enjoyed so much; to learn how to code. The summer of my graduation, I read
about popular languages to see what would be a great fit for me. My experience
in programming with Java and C# had been dull. I decided to look into
alternative languages, and the choice came down to Ruby and Python.
Thanks to Simon, I ended up as a Rubynaught.

# Process
We started out by going through the design principles of Ruby, to abolish my
Java and Python habits, and to give me a proper programming foundation.
We both felt that the way to start was to skim through some of the popular
books about Ruby and pick out the important chapters. We never read a book
cover to cover, as Simon wanted me to constantly learn the things I found
interesting, so we started out by writing code.
After each chapter Simon had prepared a task to solve or a few questions that
needed answering.
As my confidence in writing code grew, the size of the tasks he gave me grew
tougher and more motivating.

And so the time passed until my skill set was extensive enough to take on a
project on my own.  Simon wrote a fantastic article a while back, [What I wish
a Ruby programmer had told me one year ago][simons_article], where he tells the
story of how he started learning Ruby all those years ago.
The first project he started on was a to-do application; we both agreed that
this would be a fun project for me to do as well. The exercise went from a bunch
of methods to a class of its own, to a beautiful [Gem][gem_github].

## "Just write code!"
What I absolutely loved is that we just dove in and started slinging code.
This is something you can do when you have a mentor, and I highly recommend it
since I was able to skip the tedious process of reading books cover to cover
and doing small boring tasks. We went more of the [Rousseau][rousseau_wiki]
path of picking a project, then learning as we went with a small foundation
to iterate upon, and an idea of how Ruby works and what we could do with it. _The
gist of Rousseau's ideas on education is to find what the student is interested
in learning, to pique their interest._

_I was motivated by writing code instead of reading about it_, so that's what
we did the first couple of weeks. After a while, structuring and designing
systems in terms of maintainability started to interest me. As soon as anything
new sparked my interest, we started to dive into that specific subject to
facilitate this learning.

This way I was constantly learning things that motivated me, skipping the
things I found uninteresting at the time, as Simon introduced some of these
things along the way.

## Difficulties
One thing that I had a hard time learning was how to do research of my own. Our
usual procedure would look something like this: Simon and I usually talked
about the solution, how I wanted to implement it, and what boundaries we had to
work within.
Once we had settled on a solution, I would start to write out the code, but
during the larger tasks I had a harder time Googling 
how to solve problem X by doing Y.
I annoyed Simon a few times with my questions, but we managed to solve our
problems.

_Being able to do your own research is key_ when you are a real world
developer.  Having Simon force me to sit down and do the research was
a valuable lesson.

# Recommendations

* _Expectations_. It can very hard to know how to navigate and learn from the
web at first, so I think I would have been better off demonstrating my own
research techniques to Simon at the beginning. 

* _How to work_. The path of Rousseau worked like a charm for Simon and me, and
I highly recommend this to anyone taking on a mentor or being one.

* _Talk it over_. Sit down with you mentor or trainee and talk through how you
have envisioned the 'course', and what your hopes and expectations are.
The whole experience will become a lot easier for both of you if 
you have the same goals.

# Last words
I really enjoyed the experience of having Simon as my mentor, and the principles
and lessons he taught made me the developer I am today. He transformed me 
from knowing absolutely nothing about development into a full-time Ruby
developer.
Simon has now gone from being just my mentor to being one of my most loyal friends.
I would stick my neck out for this guy any day.
