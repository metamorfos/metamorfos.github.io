_This is going to be a little two - four part story on how I went from
having no experience to be a Rails Developer and loving every day of it!_

# From Zero to Hero, Part I
I started at the University of Lund in the fall of 2012 starting a
Bachelors degree in Mathematics.
After living in Lund for about 2 months I applied for a position as
Junior Rails developer in my hometown Stockholm. At the time, I've been
programming Ruby for about a year.

  So with about a year of Ruby knowledge in my bag I applied for the
job and hoped for the best. A few days went by and they replied that
they would like me to come up to Stockholm for an interview. A few
weeks later I was sitting on a plane back home to go to the interview.

  The interview was quite relaxed, I talked to the CTO about what I've
been doing prior to Lund and what I've worked on before. I told him
straight out that I've never worked as a programmer, only as Operations
Engineer for about 6 months, but I was really eager to learn and
wouldn't mind putting my back into it so to speak. He told me that
wouldn't be a problem and the interview continued with small-talk
like that.

  After about 1 hour I started pair programming with one of the
developers, what frightened me was that we were going to do TDD.
And I've never written or read test code in my life prior to that. So
he had to teach me how to write tests, why you write them and that you
_should_ write tests. It was crazy fun but really exhausting!
After about 3 hours we stopped pairing/being taught and we evaluated
our session, both him and I were pleased with how I had performed and I
had loved every minute of it.

  I talked some more to the CTO and the team about how I though it all
had gone and we agreed that I would make a good fit! I told the CTO
"Thanks but no thanks" and basically turned down the job before it was
offered to me. I told him that I felt that I should finish what I've
started in Lund before starting to work. I went home to get some rest
before heading back to Lund the following day.

  I flew back a bit anxious, _"What if I've turned down a really good
chance to do what I actually love doing?"_, _"What if, I'll never
get another chance like this?"_. The questions grew more but no
answerers were ever found...

  After being back in Lund for roughly two days my at the time
girlfriend since nearly 3 years broke up with me which made me
devastated and heartbroken. I decided to move back to Stockholm and see
if the company I was interviewed at wanted to hire my anyhow, I felt
that it was a change worth taking after my thoughts on the plane from
Stockholm to Lund.

  I took the first plane back with my necessary belongings and emailed
the CTO on the buss to the airport explaining that I was back in
Stockholm and was going to stay here for a while and asked if they were
interested in hiring me.  He told me yes, but that they already hired
two other Junior developers.
I fell facedown flat on the finishing line, reaching for my goal only
to have my arm chopped of before reaching out to take my price.

  Now I was a college dropout without a job, girlfriend or any hopes
for the future. I had no idea how though this would be the hardest
thing I've done in my life so far. But there was a light at the end of
the tunnel, see what in [part ii][part_ii]
